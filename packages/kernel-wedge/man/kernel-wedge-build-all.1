.SH NAME
kernel\-wedge\-build\-all \- build udebs for all architectures
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B kernel\-wedge build\-all
.SH DESCRIPTION
This is a wrapper script that can be used to build all architectures.

The script builds all architectures listed in kernel\-versions.
It expects to have the unpacked kernel packages for various arches in
\a../alpha, etc. modules.dep files have to be put in there too if they are
not shipped in the .deb (varies)

\fBdpkg\-cross\fR must be installed, but you do not need a cross compiler.
