debian-installer-netboot-images for Debian
------------------------------------------

  * This package contains the netboot images for all architectures that
    have netboot support in Debian Installer. Currently, this includes
    all officially supported architectures except s390x.

  * Note about versioning:
     - This package's version is simply the version of the d-i netboot
       images it fetches and ships.
     - Since d-i can be binNMU'd in stable (usually to get built against
       a newer kernel in proposed-updates, when no source changes are
       planned for stable), its version ends with +bN; using the exact
       same version for this package wouldn't work too well because a
       couple of assumptions are made in the Debian infrastructure
       (notably in dak) when a binNMU-like version number is seen. To
       work around those, the .bN suffix is used instead of the usual
       +bN suffix.
