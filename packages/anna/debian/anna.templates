_Description: Installer components to load:
 To save memory, only components that are certainly needed for an install
 are selected by default. The other installer components are not all necessary
 for a basic install, but you may need some of them, especially certain kernel
 modules, so look through the list carefully and select the components you
 need.

 Note that if you select a component that requires others, those
 components will also be loaded.

Template: anna/no_kernel_modules
Type: error
# :sl2:
_Description: No kernel modules found
 No kernel modules were found. This probably is due to a mismatch between
 the kernel used by this version of the installer and the kernel version
 available in the archive.
 .
 You should make sure that your installation image is up-to-date, or - if
 that's the case - try a different mirror, preferably deb.debian.org.
