_Description: Updates management on this system:
 Applying updates on a frequent basis is an important part of keeping the
 system secure.
 .
 By default, security updates are not automatically installed, as security
 advisories should be reviewed before manual installation of the updates
 using standard package management tools.
 .
 Alternatively the unattended-upgrades package can be installed, which will
 install security updates automatically. Note however that automatic
 installation of updates may occasionally cause unexpected downtime of
 services provided by this machine in the rare cases where the update is
 not fully backward-compatible, or where the security advisory requires the
 administrator to perform some other manual operation.

 If mlocate is installed, update its database after installing packages.
 This is time-consuming, so you may wish to set this to false to disable it.
