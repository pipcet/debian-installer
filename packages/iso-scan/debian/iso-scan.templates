_Description: Do full disk search for installer ISO image?
 The quick scan for installer ISO images, which looks only in common
 places, did not find an installer ISO image. It's possible that a
 more thorough search will find the ISO image, but it may take a long
 time.

 it may have a bad filename (not ending in ".iso"), or it may be on a
 file system that could not be mounted.

 You'll have to use an alternative installation method, select another device
 to look for ISO image, or try again after you've fixed it.

Template: iso-scan/ask_right_iso
Type: boolean
Default: true
# :sl3:
_Description: Is ISO file ${FILENAME} the correct image for installation?
 The ISO file ${FILENAME} on ${DEVICE} (${SUITE}, code ${CODENAME},
 self-described as '${DESCRIPTION}') will be used as the
 installation ISO image.
 .
 If multiple ISO files exist on the same installer drive,
 you may select which one you want to use.

Template: iso-scan/copy_iso_to_ram
Type: boolean
Default: false
# :sl3:
_Description: Copy the ISO image into RAM before mounting it?
 There is enough available memory to be able to copy the ISO image into
 RAM.
 .
 Choosing this option allows reusing the disk hosting the ISO image. If you
 don't do it, the disk will be actively used to access the ISO image and
 it can't be partitioned by the installer.
 .
 Note however that if you overwrite the disk containing the ISO image, you
 should not reboot before the end of the installation as you will not be
 able to restart the installer since the ISO image will be gone from the
 hard disk and memory.
