Description: Debian-Installer netboot assistant
 di-netboot-assistant is a tool to simplify the preparation of files
 for TFTP net booting. It downloads and extracts the files needed and
 takes care of organizing them. The packaged netboot installer as well
 as Debian Live ISO images are supported too. di-netboot-assistant
 prepares a top level menu for PXElinux and grub-efi. This allows one to
 choose from all installed netboot and Debian Live images at boot time.
 .
 di-netboot-assistant supports preseeding the installer in order to
 set up systems completely automatically.
 .
 Install grub-efi-amd64-bin to build EFI boot images, and for secure
 boot support install grub-efi-amd64-signed and shim-signed.
