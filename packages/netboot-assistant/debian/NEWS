di-netboot-assistant (0.51) unstable; urgency=medium

  Starting with this release, di-netboot-assistant will use
  '$TFTP_ROOT/d-i/n-a/' for its netboot images.  This allows one to
  serve netboot images and (optional) preseedings from within the
  common directory '$TFTP_ROOT/d-i/'.

  The directory '$TFTP_ROOT/debian-installer/' will be migrated to the
  new location during package upgrade, if di-netboot-assistant's
  README.txt exists within the directory.

  In addition, take care about the following issues:

  • Adapt the DNS server to send the new location for the boot image.

  • Adjust paths in '/etc/di-netboot-assistant/*', if you customized
    entries in 'pxelinux.HEAD' and 'grub.cfg.HEAD'.

  • If you use debian-installer-*-netboot-* packages, copy or bind
    mount them to '$TFTP_ROOT/d-i/n-pkg/' (cf. README).

  • If necessary, run "di-netboot-assistant rebuild-menu" and for EFI
    installs "di-netboot-assistant rebuild-grub".

di-netboot-assistant (0.37) unstable; urgency=low

  PXELinux tftp filenames handling changed:
  DHCP configuration should be changed: PXELinux option 210 (pathprefix)
  isn't needed anymore. Previously, one had to configure the DHCP to send
  option 210="/". This isn't required anymore (and it is deprecated).

  PXELinux configuration file should be modified: All tftp filenames in
  pxelinux.HEAD should be prefixed with "::/" so PXELinux treats them as
  absolute location, this also applies to "append initrd=::/pathto/initrd".
  Then run "di-netboot-assistant rebuild-menu".
