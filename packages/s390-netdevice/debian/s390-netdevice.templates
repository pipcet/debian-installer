_Description: No OSA-Express QDIO cards / HiperSockets
 No OSA-Express QDIO cards / HiperSockets were detected. If you are running
 VM please make sure that your card is attached to this guest.

_Description: Port:
 Please enter a relative port for this connection.

Template: s390-netdevice/qeth/layer2
Type: boolean
Default: false

_Description: Use this device in layer2 mode?
 By default OSA-Express cards use layer3 mode. In that mode LLC headers
 are removed from incoming IPv4 packets. Using the card in layer2 mode
 will make it keep the MAC addresses of IPv4 packets.

_Description: Do you accept this configuration?
 The configured parameter is:
  peer  = ${peer}

_Description: VM peer:
 Please enter the name of the VM peer you want to connect to.
 .
 If you want to connect to multiple peers, separate the names by
 colons, e.g.  tcpip:linux1.
 .
 The standard TCP/IP server name on VM is TCPIP; on VIF it's
 $TCPIP. Note: IUCV must be enabled in the VM user directory for this
 driver to work and it must be set up on both ends of the
 communication.
