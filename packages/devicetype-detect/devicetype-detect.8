.SH NAME
devicetype-detect \- attempt to detect the type of the current device
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B devicetype-detect
[\fB\-h\fR|\fB\-\-help\fR|\fB\-v\fR|\fB\-\-verbose\fR|\fB\-V\fR|\fB\-\-version\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B devicetype-detect
attempts to determine device class of the running system based on the display
size, display resolution, and presence or absence of a battery.  Depending on
the detected device, one of "phone", "desktop", "netbook", or "laptop" will
be printed to STDOUT.
.SH OPTIONS

Errors in the detection process (please report a bug)
.SH NOTES
The device type detection is necessarily crude, and would benefit hugely from
clearer product differentiation.  With "phones" having resolutions of 1280x720
or greater, "laptops" available down to 3.7" diagonal, "desktops" with internal
batteries for "power conditioning", and an increasing presence of modems, both
AT and 3G in devices of all classes, device class is often determined by the
usage model of specific individuals, rather than objective measurements of the
device.
.SH BUGS
It would be a great boon to be able to detect tablets by determining if there
is a physical keyboard available.
