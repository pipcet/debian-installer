  <title>Install the <command>Grub</command> Boot Loader
         on the drive</title>
<para>

The &architecture; boot loader is called <quote>grub</quote>.
Grub is a flexible and robust boot loader and a good default choice for
new users and old hands alike.

By default, grub will be installed on the UEFI partition/the Boot Record of
the primary drive, where
it will take over complete control of the boot process. If you prefer, you
can install it elsewhere. See the grub manual for complete information.

If you do not want to install grub, use the &BTN-GOBACK; button to get to the
main menu, and from there select whatever bootloader you would like to use.
