If you have a set of optical discs, and your machine supports booting directly
off those, great!  Simply
<phrase arch="x86">
configure your system for booting off an optical disc as described in
<xref linkend="boot-dev-select-x86"/>,
</phrase>
insert the disc, reboot, and proceed to the next chapter.

Note that certain optical drives may require special drivers, and thus be
inaccessible in the early installation stages. If it turns out the
standard way of booting off an optical disc doesn't work for your hardware,
revisit this chapter and read about alternate kernels and installation
methods which may work for you.

Even if you cannot boot from optical disc, you can probably install the
&debian; system components and any packages you want from such disc.
Simply boot using a different medium and when it's
time to install the operating system, base system, and any additional
packages, point the installation system at the optical drive.
