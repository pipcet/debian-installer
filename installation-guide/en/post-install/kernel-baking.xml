 <sect1 arch="linux-any" id="kernel-baking"><title>Compiling a New Kernel</title>
<para>

Why would someone want to compile a new kernel? It is most probably not
necessary since the default kernel shipped with &debian; handles almost all
configurations.

If you want to compile your own kernel nevertheless, this is of course
possible and we recommend the use of the <quote>make deb-pkg</quote> target.
For more information read the
