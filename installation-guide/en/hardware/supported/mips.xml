  <sect2 arch="mips;mips64el;mipsel"><title>Platforms supported by the
         &debian; &architecture; port</title>
<para>

&debian; on &arch-title; supports the following platforms:

  <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Cavium Octeon</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          Cavium designs a range of 64-bit MIPS Octeon processors which are
          mainly used in networking devices. Devices with these processors
          include the Ubiquiti EdgeRouter and the Rhino Labs UTM8.

    <varlistentry arch="mips64el;mipsel">
      <term>Loongson 3</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          Devices based on the Loongson 3A and 3B processors are supported.
          <!-- TODO list some actual devices here -->

    <varlistentry>
      <term>MIPS Malta</term>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          This platform is emulated by QEMU and is therefore a nice way
          to test and run &debian; on MIPS if you don't have the hardware.
        </para>
        <para>
          There are two Malta kernel flavours: 4kc-malta is built for 32-bit
          processors, and 5kc-malta is built for 64-bit processors.
        </para>

  </variablelist>
</para>
<para>

  In addition, other boards which contain <phrase arch="mips;mipsel">MIPS32r2
  or</phrase> MIPS64r2 based processors should also be able to run &debian;,
  however kernels for these processors are not built and the &debian;
  installer does not directly support them.

Complete information regarding supported mips/mipsel/mips64el machines can be found
at the <ulink url="&url-linux-mips;">Linux-MIPS homepage</ulink>.  In the
following, only the systems supported by the &debian; installer will be
covered.  If you are looking for support for other subarchitectures, please
contact the <ulink url="&url-list-subscribe;">
debian-&arch-listname; mailing list</ulink>.

  <sect2 arch="mips;mipsel"><title>Platforms no longer supported by the &debian; &architecture; port</title>
<para>
  Since &debian; Stretch, support for all MIPS processors which do not
  implement MIPS32 Release 2 have been dropped. Therefore the following
  platforms supported in Jessie are no longer supported:

  <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Loongson 2E and 2F</term>
      <listitem>
        These are the older Loongson processors. Devices based on them
        include the Fuloong Mini-PC and the Lemote Yeeloong laptop.
      </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>SGI IP22</term>
      <listitem>
        This platform includes the SGI machines Indy, Indigo 2 and Challenge S.
      </listitem>

    <varlistentry>
      <term>SGI IP32</term>
      <listitem>This platform is generally known as SGI O2.</listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
      <term>Broadcom BCM91250</term>
      <listitem>
        Development board for Broadcom's SiByte core. Also known by its
        codename SWARM.
