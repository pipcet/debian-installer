 <title>Memory and Disk Space Requirements</title>

<para>

You must have at least &minimum-memory; of memory and &minimum-fs-size;
of hard disk space to perform a normal installation. Note that these are
fairly minimal numbers. For more realistic figures, see
<xref linkend="minimum-hardware-reqts"/>.

The installer normally automatically enables memory-saving tricks to be able to
run on such low-memory system, but on architectures that are less tested
it may miss doing so. It can however be enabled manually by appending the
<userinput>lowmem=1</userinput> or even <userinput>lowmem=2</userinput> boot
parameter (see also <xref linkend="lowmem"/> and
<xref linkend="installer-args"/>).

</para><warning condition="lowmem-unchecked"><para>

On &architecture; the lowmem levels have not been tested, so automatic detection
is probably outdated and you thus probably <emphasis>need</emphasis> to pass the
boot parameter if your system has little memory.

Installation on systems with less memory<footnote condition="gtk">

<para>

Installation images that support the graphical installer require more
memory than images that support only the text-based installer and should
not be used on systems with less than &minimum-memory; of memory. If
there is a choice between booting the text-based and the graphical installer,
the former should be selected on such systems.
