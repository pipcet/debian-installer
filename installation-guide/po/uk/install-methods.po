"Some SPARC architectures add the subarchitecture names, such as "
"<quote>SUN4M</quote> or <quote>SUN4C</quote>, to the filename. Thus, if your "
"system's subarchitecture is a SUN4C, and its IP is 192.168.1.3, the filename "
"would be <filename>C0A80103.SUN4C</filename>. However, there are also "
"subarchitectures where the file the client looks for is just "
"<filename>client-ip-in-hex</filename>. An easy way to determine the "
"hexadecimal code for the IP address is to enter the following command in a "
"shell (assuming the machine's intended IP is 10.0.0.4). "
"<informalexample><screen>\n"
"$ printf '%.2x%.2x%.2x%.2x\\n' 10 0 0 4\n"
"</screen></informalexample> To get to the correct filename, you will need to "
"change all letters to uppercase and if necessary append the subarchitecture "
"name."
