This document briefly describes how to make a installation-guide release.

- First make sure to be up to date

    git pull

- Set the release date

    dch -r

    and set the package version to the date.

- Commit that

    git commit

- Build (use a machine with a lot of cores to make this fast)

    pdebuild

- Compare against a previous version to make sure we didn't mess it up
  completely

    debdiff installation-guide_2017WWWW_amd64.changes installation-guide_2017XXXX_amd64.changes

- Upload the result

- When ACCEPTed, Tag the commit:

    git tag 2017XXXX
    git push
    git push --tags
