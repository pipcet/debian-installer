# This comment can also be used to generate a Build-Depends-Indep line, by
# running the debian/genbuilddeps program. So put each build dep on its own
# line, prefixed by " - " and to comment out a build dep, start the line
# with two hashes. And don't edit the Build-Depends-Indep line above by hand.
